The SEEKR is a state-of-the-art drone with a thermal camera appended on the bottom of it. The SEEKR undertakes the challenge of finding people during the aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis. The thermal camera is utilised do such. Also conjoined to the drone is an Arduino that has been programmed to transmit the thermal camera’s footage to your phone. The SEEKR is closely tied to solving a small section of natural disasters, displaced people. The prototype of the SEEKR is a mere 3D printed design that has no function whatsoever. It is only used to depict what the SEEKR would look like as a real product. If we were to make the SEEKR, we would buy a drone and a thermal camera that is compatible with the drone. (most likely one with a USB-C) We could code an Arduino to wirelessly transmit the data from the thermal camera to your phone/drone remote. Creating the SEEKR would cost around $150. The SEEKR would make a huge impact on the world and people using it because the SEEKR is used to find lives; lives with meaning. For example, if someone was displaced due to a fatal disaster and the SEEKR finds them, it would save people lots of grief and time that they would have lost if the SEEKR hadn’t found them. The person whom the SEEKR found would have their life saved.
