This project is about education being shared around the world. Our product is digital, so many people will be able to access it. It works on the 4th global goal, Quality Education. 5.17 billion people have mobile devices, which is 66.77% of the population in the entire world. What about the poorer countries? The country with the lowest percentage of users is Switzerland, which has 6.2 million users only, but only because of the population. This means that 72.34% of the population of Switzerland has a phone. This shows that there is a good chance each school has at least someone who can connect to devices and our product. 

Our prototype is on a Google Sites. It contains split products which provide guidance to teachers and parents to educate their students with resources and tasks. However, for more options, professional domains would be used in the actual product. There will be more detail in the parent and teacher guides in the real product, and probably the coverage of specific units with more tasks and resources.
